# About this project

There are so many electronic instruments and wearable devices out there today, and yet none have managed to make my body sway involuntarily and get up and groove to the music.

Why is that?

I made Banggos for that sole purpose.

A tap to the crotch and the music starts. That's all there is to it. There's only one key because it's that simple. And wearable. It doesn't have to be complicated to be genius. Simple. Stylish. Silly. Let's bring a new definition to the word "musical instrument".

This is the instrument I envisioned.

4. Device pocket. Even if there is no inserted device, undergarments cannot be seen. You can replace your Banggos device with your iPhone. Or pocket tissues. Or whatever.
5. Side pockets on each side and one back pocket
6. Elastic ankles
7. Made of twill fabric that is thick and wrinkle-free. Works with formal attire as well.
8. Flexible twill fabric made of rayon and stretchy material is easy to move in and can be worn over regular pants.

# WIFI Setting

Rock your Banggos with the WiFi access point mode.
You will receive a card with SSID and password information for your iOS or Mac device.

Sensors of the Banggos Device

The sensor comes in two different types.

One is a soft touch sensor that sends vibrations from taps directly to the crotch area.
The other is in a simple push-button style that enables quality performance.
