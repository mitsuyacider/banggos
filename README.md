# iOS App
This app interacts with our wearable device carrying a WiFi module. But you can also enjoy withour the device. If you have our elegant pants equiped with the device, you need additional steps at launch. Before using this app, make sure your iPhone connects the WiFi. Once the connection has established, the wearable device can communicate to your iPhone via our app to play sound. There are five options for sound, Bell, Clap, Cymbal, voice and pre-recorded audio.
